# Project Persephone

Persephone is a privacy-oriented, cloud native revenge porn alert system. 

Revenge porn is the non-consensual and often illegal posting of intimate photos, or "nudes" to public websites. Revenge porn uploads frequently identify the victim by name and location, regularly leading to significant trauma for the targetted individual. Often the victim only becomes unaware that their photos have been uploaded once they have spread significantly.

Persephone aims to swiftly identify victims and refer them to legal and mental health resources as quickly as possible to minimize the spread and harm of the uploads. The system scrapes revenge porn internet forums, identifies victim details using NLP, and then compiles case reports for possible intervention. No images are stored, and the victim details are automatically encrypted to be accessed only by law enforcement and appropriate professionals.

Currently Persephone monitors geography-based web forums covering all US states, and over 20 countries.

***This project is a work in progress. Specifically, the API, frontend, and alert system are under continuous development.***
