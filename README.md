# Project Persephone

Persephone is a scalable, cloud native revenge porn alert system. 

Revenge porn is the non-consensual and often illegal posting of intimate photos, or "nudes" to public websites. Reveng porn uploads often identify the victim by name and location, often leading to significant trauma for the targetted individual. Often the victim only becomes unaware that their photos have been uploaded once they have spread significantly.
 
Persephone aims to swiftly identify victims and refer them to legal and mental health resources as quickly as possible. The system scrapes revenge porn internet forums, identifies victim details using NLP, and then compiles case reports for possible intervention.

Currently Persephone monitors geography-based web forums covering all US states, and over 20 countries.

This project is a work in progress. Specifically, the API, frontend, and alert system are under continuous development.
